# YT-antispammer
Are you fucking tired of bots changing their scams by a single digit to avoid your blocked words on YouTube? Are you sick and tired of spending 10 minutes after every upload mass deleting comments? We can't fix the problem (only YouTube can), but we can help.

# What is this?
I wish I could say it was more impressive, but it's literally a crowd-sourced collection of spam terms reported by YouTubers like yourself.

# How do I use it?
1. Open the document with the terms
2. Copy them
3. Paste them in your YouTube blocked words

# Will this stop all bots?
No. YouTube is a bitch. This is their fault. But it'll at least stop the most common ones and it'll make other YouTubers aware of the newest ones that may impact them.

# Why did you do this?
Because I'm tired on a Monday night with nothing better to do.
